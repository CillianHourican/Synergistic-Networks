Network construction requires the jointpdf package (https://bitbucket.org/rquax/jointpdf/src/master/).
To ease implementation, we have provided some files from this package. 

Note: A python-based toolbox for effeciently creating networks with synergistic interactions, finding synergistic associations in data using O-information and SRVs, and creating subsequent hypergrapgs is currently in progress. Once released, a link wil be provided here.
